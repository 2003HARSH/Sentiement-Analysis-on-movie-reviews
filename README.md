# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews using Word2Vec

Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews is a natural language processing (NLP) project aimed at analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews using Word2Vec embedding techniques. This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment conveyed in the text.


## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a valuable application of natural language processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus specifically on movie reviews and use Word2Vec embeddings to represent words in a continuous vector space. This allows us to capture semantic relationships between words and improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.

## Features

- Preprocessing of movie review text data ðŸ§¹
- Word2Vec embedding of movie review text ðŸ“Š
- Training and evaluation of sentiment classification models ðŸ“ˆ
- Visualization of Word2Vec embeddings and model performance metrics ðŸ“Š
